# InverterML
This repository contains scripts that were created in the investigation of a Three-Phase IGBT Two-Level Inverter for Electrical Drives. 
To run each Python script all you need to do is download the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stender/inverter-data-set
Extract the dataset add the directory address to the pd.read_csv command in each script and run the code. 
Have fun :)
